This project isn't too far along yet. I want to do a top-down mountain adventure game with action and puzzle solving elements. Vaguely similar in gameplay to legend of zelda, but set in the Alps in the 1920s.


NOTE: I'm in the middle of transitioning the script engine to a custom lisp dialect, and the build system isn't very user-friendly right now.
